# keeperupper
A python program to check the status of your websites (geared towards replit)

Yeah i know it doesn't actually keep the site up it's a bad name. Can't be bothered to change it though.

# Installation
### Requirements:
* `python>=3.8` because I like the walrus operator
* the python `requests` library (found in `requirements.txt`)

# Configuration
This program uses the [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) library to parse Windows-INI-like configuration files such as the contents of `example.cfg`. Check the file out.
